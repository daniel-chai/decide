Decide is a mobile application built using the Ionic framework, with Node.js / MongoDB used for the backend.
It allows people to send out polls so that other people can vote on the choices.
The voting mechanism is designed to be fun - people swipe left or right to vote. 
The results are gathered and displayed for whoever sent out the poll.

Further work on this project is intended in the future.
